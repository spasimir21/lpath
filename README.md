# lpath

A simple linux utility to handle path.

# Build

The build in the dist folder is for x64 only.  
If you want to use x86, you can build it using nexe (Tested with Node v12.9.1).  
The command I used (Node v12.9.1):
```bash
nexe cli.js -o ./dist/lpath 
```

# Install

Run:  
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spasimir21/lpath/master/install.sh | sh
```

# Docs

See a quick documented example of the .path file format from example.path.  
For help with the cli run (Make sure lpath is properly installed):
```bash
lpath --help
```
